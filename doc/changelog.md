### Known Bugs
this is probably due to:
```java
    /// SplatterEffectRenderer
    matrices.translate(-camPos.x, -camPos.y, -camPos.z);

    /// PoseStack
    public void translate(double x, double y, double z) {
        this.translate((float)x, (float)y, (float)z);
    }
```
* Managed to get the "right" key to register as constantly pressed, screwing with dashes
  * i assume this works for any direction
* Enemies can attack through dimensions (hit something -> D4C ult -> attacked by out-of-world ent)
  this bug is EVIL and has an unclear source >:(
  in the future, try looking at what sets the enemies target to null
  its obfuscated because of how goals are wrapped, but it's probably possible to figure out
  To add to this, the loading of chunks in D4Cs dimension should be done with tickets instead of a mass forceload
## Forge
* The client doesn't register The Sun as it's stand if moved out of and into render distance
  in Fabric, it simply unloads when out of sight. This behavior is preferable
* When connected to Forge dedicated server, JCraft commands do not autocomplete correctly
